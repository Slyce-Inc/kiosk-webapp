# kiosk_webapp
Simple webpage loaded with buttons that will trigger events on the kiosk
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run: python app.py <br />
<br />
Currently not dockertized. Requires both Python and Node JS dependencies. 
See requirements.txt for python and package.json for Node (installed with Yarn). 
<br />
Does not actually connect to a real Kiosk. Only connects to a "dumby" server (serve.js)
All events are predefined and can be found in the events folder.
